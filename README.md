# spring-boot-sample
spring-boot-sample project

## Idea
Lots of tutorials exist for spring-boot. The idea of this project is to
demo common features with spring-boot provided libraries.

Less custom code would require less effort to maintain and extend

Some features:
- pagination
- swagger
- custom repository
- read custom queries from file

building a complex query string via many functions is not easy to understand.
it would be easier to read many different queries from a file. Also the string in Java
is limited to be separated by many `+`
